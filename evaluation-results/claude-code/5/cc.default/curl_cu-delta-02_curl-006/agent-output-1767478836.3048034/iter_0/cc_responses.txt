I can see the bug. Looking at line 232:

```c
else if(strcasecmp(response, "crashycrashy\r\n") == 0) {
    *(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
}
```

The issue is that `result` is a `CURLcode` variable (which is an enum/integer), not a pointer. The code is trying to dereference `result` as a pointer (`*(unsigned int *)result`), but since `result` is `CURLE_OK` (which is 0), this tries to write to memory address 0x0 (null pointer), causing the SEGV.

The fix is simple - it should just assign to `result` directly, not dereference it:

```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

Let me apply the patch:

I've applied the patch to fix the AddressSanitizer SEGV bug.

**Summary of the fix:**

- **File:** `/home/qqor/crete/.cache/official-afc-curl/lib/totallyfineprotocl.c`
- **Line:** 232
- **Bug:** The original code `*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;` attempted to cast the `CURLcode` variable `result` (which had value 0/CURLE_OK at that point) to a pointer and dereference it. This caused a null pointer dereference (writing to address 0x0).
- **Fix:** Changed to `result = CURLE_OK;` which correctly assigns the value to the variable instead of trying to dereference it as a pointer.
