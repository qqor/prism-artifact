Looking at the crash log, I can see the issue is a "Permission denied" error when trying to execute `/out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt`. This is typically caused by the fuzzer binary not having executable permissions set after it's built.

Let me explore the codebase to find where the fuzzer is built and how to fix this permission issue.

Let me look for the source directory structure and any build-related files:

Let me read the build.sh file from the source directory:

Now I can see the bug clearly. In the `build.sh` file, lines 60-61 are removing the execute permissions from the fuzzer binaries:

```bash
# Unset the original binaries so our infra doesn't see them until they're ready
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer_mt
```

This removes the execute permission, causing the "Permission denied" error when trying to run `/out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt`.

The fix should be to either:
1. Remove these lines entirely, or
2. Add `chmod +x` commands at the end to restore executable permissions

Looking at the context, it seems like there was intended to be some additional processing before making them executable again, but that step was never added. The workaround script at line 56-57 gets `chmod +x`, but the main fuzzers don't get their permissions restored.

Let me create a patch to fix this bug by removing the lines that remove execute permissions:

The patch has been applied successfully. Here's a summary of the fix:

## Bug Summary

**Problem:** The crash log showed "Permission denied" when trying to execute `/out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt`. This was caused by the build script explicitly removing execute permissions from the fuzzer binaries with:
```bash
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer_mt
```

**Root Cause:** Lines 60-61 in `/home/qqor/crete/packages/python_oss_fuzz/.oss_fuzz/projects/dav1d/build.sh` were intentionally removing executable permissions with the comment "Unset the original binaries so our infra doesn't see them until they're ready" - but the permissions were never restored.

**Fix Applied:** Changed the `chmod -x` commands to `chmod +x` so the fuzzer binaries are executable after the build completes:
```bash
# Ensure fuzzer binaries are executable
chmod +x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer
chmod +x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer_mt
```

This ensures that when the Docker container tries to run `/out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt`, it will have the necessary execute permissions.
