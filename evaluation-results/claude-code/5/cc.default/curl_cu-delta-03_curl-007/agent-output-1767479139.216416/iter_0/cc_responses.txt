I can see the bug. Looking at line 253:

```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```

This is the problematic line. `result` is a `CURLcode` (which is an enum/integer type) with value `CURLE_OK` (which is 0). The code is incorrectly casting `result` to a pointer and dereferencing it, which causes a null pointer dereference (writing to address 0x0).

The fix should simply be:
```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

Let me apply this fix:

## Summary

**Bug:** Line 253 in `/home/user/crete/.cache/official-afc-curl/lib/alliswellprotocoll.c` contained a critical null pointer dereference:

```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```

**Problem:** `result` is a local variable of type `CURLcode` (an enum) with value `CURLE_OK` which equals `0`. The buggy code was casting this integer value `0` to a pointer (`unsigned int *`) and then dereferencing it to write a value. This caused a SEGV by attempting to write to memory address `0x0` (null pointer).

**Fix:** Changed the line to a simple assignment:
```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

This correctly assigns the `CURLE_OK` value to the `result` variable instead of treating it as a pointer.
