Now I understand the issue. The `processURL` method (lines 268-285) makes network requests to URLs found in HYPERLINK patterns in CSV cells, which can lead to SSRF vulnerabilities. The method directly opens a connection to any URL specified in the cell content without any validation.

The fix should disable or remove the external URL fetching functionality in the `processURL` method. I'll modify the method to not make external network requests.

Now let me also remove the unused imports that are no longer needed after this change:

The patch has been successfully applied. Here's a summary of the changes made to fix the SSRF vulnerability:

## Summary of Changes

**File Modified:** `tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-text-module/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/parser/csv/TextAndCSVParser.java`

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed the SSRF-vulnerable code in `processURL()` method** (lines 268-285):
   - The original method was opening network connections to arbitrary URLs found in HYPERLINK patterns in CSV cells
   - The new implementation is an empty method that simply does nothing, preventing any network requests from being made

2. **Removed unused imports**:
   - `java.net.URL`
   - `java.net.URLConnection`
   - `org.apache.tika.extractor.EmbeddedDocumentExtractor`
   - `org.apache.tika.extractor.EmbeddedDocumentUtil`
   - `org.apache.tika.io.TikaInputStream`
   - `org.apache.tika.utils.ExceptionUtils`

### Security Impact:
The fix prevents Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks where malicious CSV files containing HYPERLINK formulas could cause the server to make arbitrary network requests. The hyperlinks are still parsed and rendered as `<a>` elements in the output, but no actual network requests are made to fetch content from the URLs.
