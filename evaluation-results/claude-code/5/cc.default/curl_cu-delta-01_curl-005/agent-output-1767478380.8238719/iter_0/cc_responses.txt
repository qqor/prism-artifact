I'll help you fix the bug. However, I notice you haven't provided the bug description yet. Could you please share:

1. **The bug description** - What is the issue that needs to be fixed?
2. **The source directory** - Where is the code located that needs to be patched?

Once you provide these details, I'll analyze the code and create a patch to fix the bug.
