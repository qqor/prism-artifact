The crash is happening at line 385 in `rx_icmp`. Looking at the crash log, it says `READ of size 1 at 0x504000000172` at line 385. The crash is in `rx_icmp` function when accessing `pkt->icmp->type`. Let me look at more context:

Now let me look at the `rx_ip` function to see how `pkt->icmp` gets set:

Now I understand the issue! Let me look at lines 802-803:

```c
pkt->icmp = (struct icmp *) (pkt->ip + 1);
if (pkt->pay.len < sizeof(*pkt->icmp)) return;
```

The problem is that when IPv4 options are present (IHL > 5), `pkt->icmp` is being set to `pkt->ip + 1` which points right after the base IP header (20 bytes), but the actual ICMP data starts after all the IP options. The `mkpay` function in the previous patch correctly adjusts `pkt->pay` to point after the IP options, but `pkt->icmp` is incorrectly set to `pkt->ip + 1` regardless of IP options.

Let me see how `mkpay` works and understand the payload structure:

Now I understand fully:

1. In `mg_tcpip_rx` (lines 891-894), when IP options are present, `mkpay` is called to correctly set `pkt->pay` to point after the IP options.
2. However, in `rx_ip` (line 802), `pkt->icmp` is set to `pkt->ip + 1`, which assumes the ICMP header is right after the base IP header (20 bytes). But when IP options are present, the ICMP header is actually at `pkt->pay.buf` (which was set correctly by mkpay in mg_tcpip_rx).

The failed patch tried to fix the IP header length check in `mg_tcpip_rx`, but the real issue is in `rx_ip` where `pkt->icmp` (and similarly `pkt->udp`, `pkt->tcp`) is set incorrectly when IP options are present.

The fix should be in `rx_ip` to set `pkt->icmp` to the correct location, which is where `pkt->pay.buf` currently points (since `mkpay` was already called with the correct offset for IP options in `mg_tcpip_rx`).

Now I understand the issue completely. The key insight is:

1. **Before** `rx_ip` is called, `mkpay` has already been called in `mg_tcpip_rx` to set `pkt->pay.buf` to point to the correct start of the IP payload (after any IP options).

2. **In** `rx_ip`, the code incorrectly assumes `pkt->ip + 1` is where the protocol headers start, but this is only true when there are no IP options. When IP options are present, the protocol headers (ICMP/UDP/TCP) actually start at `pkt->pay.buf`.

The fix approach should use `pkt->pay.buf` (which already points to the correct location after IP options) instead of `pkt->ip + 1`.

Here's the fix for the `rx_ip` function:

## Explanation

### Why the Previous Patch Failed

The previous patch tried to fix the issue in `mg_tcpip_rx` by adding validation for the IP header length and ensuring the packet isn't truncated. While those checks are good defensive measures, they didn't address the **root cause**: the `rx_ip` function was using `pkt->ip + 1` to locate the protocol headers (ICMP, UDP, TCP), which incorrectly assumes the IP header is always exactly 20 bytes (no options).

When IPv4 options are present (IHL > 5), the IP header is larger than 20 bytes, but `pkt->ip + 1` only advances by `sizeof(struct ip)` (20 bytes), causing it to point into the middle of the IP options rather than to the actual ICMP/UDP/TCP header. This leads to the heap-buffer-overflow when trying to read the ICMP type field.

### Why This New Patch Works

The new patch takes a completely different approach:

1. **Uses `pkt->pay.buf` instead of `pkt->ip + 1`**: By the time `rx_ip` is called, `mg_tcpip_rx` has already called `mkpay` to correctly set `pkt->pay.buf` to point to the first byte after the IP header (including any options). So `pkt->pay.buf` always points to the correct start of the transport layer header.

2. **Consistent handling**: This fix applies to all protocols (ICMP, UDP, TCP) and also fixes the fragmented packet case, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of IP options.

3. **No additional validation needed**: Since `pkt->pay.buf` is already correctly computed by `mkpay` with proper bounds, and the subsequent `pkt->pay.len` checks ensure there's enough data for the protocol header, no additional validation is needed.
