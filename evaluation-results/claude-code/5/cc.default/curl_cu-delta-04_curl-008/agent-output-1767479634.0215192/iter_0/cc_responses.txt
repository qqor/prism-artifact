I'll help you fix a bug. However, I notice you haven't provided:

1. **The bug description** - What is the bug you want me to fix?
2. **The source directory** - Where is the code located?

Could you please provide:
- A description of the bug (error messages, unexpected behavior, etc.)
- The path to the source directory
- Any relevant file names or code snippets that might help identify the issue
