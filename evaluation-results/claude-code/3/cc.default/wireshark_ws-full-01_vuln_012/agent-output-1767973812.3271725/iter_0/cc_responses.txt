Now I understand the bug. Looking at the `dissect_zbee_zdp_req_mgmt_nwk_disc` function starting at line 188, I can see the issue. The bug is on line 243-248 where there's a `printf` statement with format specifiers that don't match the arguments:

```c
printf("DEBUG:\t(0x%x/0x%x)\t%d / 0x%x\t%s\n",
        i, channels,
        channels_arr[i]->channel_id,
        channels_arr[i]->channels,
        channels_arr[i]->free_text,
        channels_arr[i]->text);
```

The format string has 5 specifiers (`%x`, `%x`, `%d`, `%x`, `%s`) but 6 arguments are provided. The issue is:
1. `channels_arr[i]->free_text` is being printed with `%s` format specifier but it's an integer
2. `channels_arr[i]->text` is being passed as an extra argument, but since `free_text` is an int (0 or 1), when `printf` tries to interpret it as a string for `%s`, it causes a SEGV

The actual bug is that the format string is wrong - it should have `%d` for `free_text` and `%s` for `text`, making the format string expect 6 arguments. But looking more closely, the correct fix should either:
1. Add `%s` to print `channels_arr[i]->text`
2. Or, more likely given this appears to be debug code, simply remove the entire problematic debug `printf` block

Since this is debug code that shouldn't be in production (the `printf` statement is inappropriate for a network dissector), the safest fix is to remove the entire conditional debug block (lines 241-249).

## Bug Analysis

**Root Cause**: In the `dissect_zbee_zdp_req_mgmt_nwk_disc` function at line 243, there was a `printf` statement with a format string mismatch:

```c
printf("DEBUG:\t(0x%x/0x%x)\t%d / 0x%x\t%s\n",
        i, channels,
        channels_arr[i]->channel_id,
        channels_arr[i]->channels,
        channels_arr[i]->free_text,  // This int was matched with %s
        channels_arr[i]->text);       // This was an extra argument
```

The format string had 5 format specifiers (`%x`, `%x`, `%d`, `%x`, `%s`) but 6 arguments were passed. The `%s` specifier was incorrectly matched with `channels_arr[i]->free_text` (an integer), causing `printf` to interpret the integer value as a memory address to read a string from, resulting in the SEGV.

## Fix Applied

Removed the entire debug block (lines 241-249) since:
1. Debug `printf` statements are inappropriate in production network dissector code
2. The code block had an incorrect format string that caused crashes
3. The debug output served no production purpose

The fix removes the problematic conditional block while preserving all the functional code before and after it.
