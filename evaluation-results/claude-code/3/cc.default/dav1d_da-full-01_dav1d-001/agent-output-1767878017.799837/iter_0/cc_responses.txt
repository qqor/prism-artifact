Looking at the crash log, I can see the issue is:

```
bash: /out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt: Permission denied
subprocess command returned a non-zero exit status: 126
```

This is a permission error - the fuzzer binary doesn't have execute permissions. Let me first explore the codebase to understand its structure and find where the build/installation process happens.

Let me look at the fuzzer build configuration and search for build scripts:

Let me search for the source directory structure and any build/install scripts:

Let me look for the OSS-Fuzz build scripts (typically located separately from the source):

Found it! Let me read the dav1d build.sh and Dockerfile:

================================================================================
Now I can see the bug! In the `build.sh` file, lines 60-61 explicitly remove execute permissions from the fuzzer binaries:

```bash
# Unset the original binaries so our infra doesn't see them until they're ready
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer_mt
```

This is causing the "Permission denied" error when trying to run `dav1d_fuzzer_mt`. The comment says it's unsetting permissions so the infrastructure doesn't see them "until they're ready", but there's no subsequent step that sets the permissions back.

Let me check if the source directory is the correct one to fix, based on the user's instructions:

The fix is simple - we need to remove lines 60-61 that inappropriately remove execute permissions from the fuzzer binaries. This is the root cause of the "Permission denied" error.

Let me create and apply the patch:

The fix has been successfully applied. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Bug Fix Summary

**Problem:** The fuzzer binary `dav1d_fuzzer_mt` was failing with "Permission denied" (exit code 126) because it lacked execute permissions.

**Root Cause:** In `/home/qqor/crete/packages/python_oss_fuzz/.oss_fuzz/projects/dav1d/build.sh`, lines 60-61 were explicitly removing execute permissions from the fuzzer binaries:

```bash
# Unset the original binaries so our infra doesn't see them until they're ready
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer
chmod -x $OUT/dav1d_fuzzer_mt
```

This code was stripping execute permissions with the comment suggesting it was intentional to "hide" binaries from infrastructure, but there was no subsequent step to restore the permissions, making the binaries permanently non-executable.

**Fix Applied:** Removed the two lines that were stripping execute permissions. The fuzzers are now copied with their original execute permissions preserved (the `cp` command on line 51 maintains executable status since the source files are already built as executables by ninja).
