I'll analyze the crash log and create a patch to fix the AddressSanitizer SEGV bug.

From the crash log, I can see:
1. The crash occurs at `/src/curl/lib/verynormalprotocol.c:141:29` in `verynormalprotocol_doing`
2. It's a null pointer dereference (WRITE memory access to address 0x000000000000)
3. The call stack shows: `verynormalprotocol_doing` -> `protocol_doing` -> `multi_runsingle` -> `curl_multi_perform`

Let me first find and read the problematic file:

Perfect! I found the bug. At line 141, there's a dangerous operation:

```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```

This line is casting the `CURLcode result` variable (which is an enum/integer type) to a pointer and then attempting to write to it. This is a null pointer dereference bug because `result` contains the value `CURLE_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY` (an integer), not a valid memory address.

The fix is simple - this should just be a regular assignment:
```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

Let me create and apply the patch:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the AddressSanitizer SEGV bug in `/home/qqor/crete/.cache/official-afc-curl/lib/verynormalprotocol.c`.

**The Bug:**
At line 141, there was a dangerous pointer cast operation:
```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```

This code was treating the `result` variable (an enum/integer type) as a memory address and attempting to write to it, causing a null pointer dereference.

**The Fix:**
Changed line 141 to a simple assignment:
```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

This properly assigns the value `CURLE_OK` to the `result` variable instead of attempting to write through an invalid pointer. The patch has been applied successfully to the source file.
