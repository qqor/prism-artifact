Now I can see the issue. Looking at the crash log, the timeout occurs at `Type1Parser.parseBinary(Type1Parser.java:640)`. The issue is in the while loop at line 640-644 that searches for `/CharStrings` without a proper termination condition:

```java
while (!(lexer.peekKind(Token.LITERAL)
        && lexer.peekToken().getText().equals("CharStrings")))
{
    lexer.nextToken();
}
```

This loop can run indefinitely if `/CharStrings` is never found. The fix should add a check for `lexer.peekToken() == null` to prevent infinite loops.

The patch has been applied successfully. The fix adds a null check inside the while loop that searches for the `/CharStrings` token. Without this check, if the lexer reaches the end of the input without finding `/CharStrings`, the loop would run indefinitely causing the 25-second timeout.

**Summary of the fix:**

The bug was in the `parseBinary` method at line 640. The while loop that searches for the `/CharStrings` dictionary had no termination condition if the token was never found. This caused an infinite loop when parsing malformed Type 1 fonts.

The fix adds a null check that throws an `IOException` with a descriptive message (`"/CharStrings token not found"`) when the lexer reaches the end of input, preventing the infinite loop and timeout.
