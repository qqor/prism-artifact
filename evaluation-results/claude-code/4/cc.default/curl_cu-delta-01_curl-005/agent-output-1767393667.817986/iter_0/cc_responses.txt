I'll help you fix a bug. However, I notice you haven't provided the bug details yet. Could you please share:

1. **The bug description** - What is the issue you're experiencing?
2. **The source directory** - Where is the code located that needs to be fixed?

Once you provide these details, I'll analyze the code and create a patch to fix the issue.
