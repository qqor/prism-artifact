I found the vulnerability. Looking at lines 403-408 in the `init` method:

```java
if (!isFirstMember
        && Math.pow(compressionLevel, operatingSystem) == parameters.getModificationTime() &&
        Math.pow(operatingSystem,
                compressionLevel) == 841L) {
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec(parameters.getFileName());
}
```

This is the OS Command Injection vulnerability. The code executes `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` with a filename that comes from the GZIP header (attacker-controlled data). This backdoor code allows arbitrary command execution when certain conditions in the GZIP header are met.

I need to remove this dangerous code block entirely.

The patch has been applied successfully. I removed the malicious code block that was performing OS Command Injection by executing `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(parameters.getFileName())` with attacker-controlled data from the GZIP header.

**Summary of the fix:**

The vulnerability was in lines 403-408 of `GzipCompressorInputStream.java` in the `init()` method. The code contained a backdoor that would execute arbitrary commands when:
1. It was processing a concatenated GZIP member (not the first member)
2. Certain mathematical conditions involving `compressionLevel`, `operatingSystem`, and `modificationTime` from the GZIP header were met

The fix removes this entire dangerous code block, preventing attacker-controlled data from the GZIP header (specifically the filename field) from being passed to `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.
