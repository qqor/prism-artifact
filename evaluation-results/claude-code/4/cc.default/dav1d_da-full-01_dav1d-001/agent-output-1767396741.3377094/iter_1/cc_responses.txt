Looking at the crash log, the issue is clear:

```
bash: /out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt: Permission denied
```

The fuzzer binary `/out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt` doesn't have execute permission. Let me examine the relevant files to understand the context better.

Now I understand the issue:

## Why the Previous Patch Failed

The previous patch removed the `chmod -x` on line 24, but it **didn't address the real problem**. The script:

1. Line 17: `chmod +x $this_dir/dav1d_fuzzer_mt` - tries to add execute permission
2. Line 19: Runs the fuzzer
3. Line 24: `chmod -x $this_dir/dav1d_fuzzer_mt` - removes execute permission

The problem is that in the Docker container environment, the `/out` directory is mounted from the host. The `chmod +x` on line 17 **fails silently** because:
1. The script is running in a container where the filesystem might be read-only or have restricted permissions
2. The `chmod` command can't actually modify the permissions of the mounted binary

So even though the patch removed line 24, line 17's `chmod +x` still fails silently, and the binary never gets execute permission.

## The Solution

We need a completely different approach. Instead of trying to manipulate permissions (which doesn't work in this environment), we should **invoke the binary differently** - using a method that doesn't require the binary itself to have execute permission.

We can use `sh` or the dynamic linker to execute the binary, or simply assume the binary is already executable and remove all the chmod operations.

Here's the new patch:

```

This approach uses the dynamic linker (`ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`) to execute the binary directly, bypassing the need for execute permission on the binary itself. The dynamic linker can load and execute an ELF binary even if it doesn't have the execute bit set.
