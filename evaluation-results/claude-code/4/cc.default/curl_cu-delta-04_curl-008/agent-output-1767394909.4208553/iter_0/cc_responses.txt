I'd be happy to help you fix a bug. However, I notice that you haven't provided the details of the bug you'd like me to fix. Could you please share:

1. **The bug description** - What is the issue you're experiencing?
2. **The source directory** - Where is the code located that needs to be patched?
3. **Any relevant error messages or reproduction steps** - This will help me understand the problem better.

Once you provide these details, I can investigate the code, create a patch to fix the bug, and apply it to the appropriate files.
