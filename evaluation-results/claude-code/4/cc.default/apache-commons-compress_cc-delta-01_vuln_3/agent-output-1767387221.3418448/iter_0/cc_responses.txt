The stack overflow is caused by a regex pattern causing recursive backtracking. The crash log mentions `CompressTarFuzzer`, so let me look at the tar-related files that use regex patterns:

I found the issue! Looking at line 222-223, there's a regex pattern that can cause catastrophic backtracking:

```java
private static final Pattern PAX_EXTENDED_HEADER_FILE_TIMES_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(
        "(-?(?:\\d{1,19}|(?:.|\\d)*))(?:\\.\\d{1,19})?");
```

The problematic part is `(?:.|\\d)*` - this is a pattern that can match any character OR a digit multiple times. When combined with the alternation `\\d{1,19}|(?:.|\\d)*`, the regex engine can try exponentially many combinations when matching certain inputs, leading to a stack overflow due to recursive backtracking.

The regex is trying to validate PAX extended header file time values (seconds with optional decimal fractions). Let me understand what the pattern should match:

1. An optional negative sign `-?`
2. Either 1-19 digits OR anything (but this allows bad input)
3. Optionally followed by `.` and 1-19 digits for sub-second precision

The issue is that `(?:.|\\d)*` is redundant (`.` already matches `\d`) and creates massive backtracking. The correct fix is to simplify this to just match the intended numeric format:

- A valid time value should be: optional negative sign, digits, optionally followed by a decimal point and more digits

Let me create the fix:

The patch has been applied. Let me summarize the fix:

## Summary

**Bug:** Stack overflow caused by catastrophic regex backtracking in `TarArchiveEntry.java`

**Root Cause:** The regex pattern `PAX_EXTENDED_HEADER_FILE_TIMES_PATTERN` at line 222-223 contained the problematic alternation `(?:\\d{1,19}|(?:.|\\d)*)`. The `(?:.|\\d)*` part creates exponential backtracking behavior because:
1. `.` matches any character (including digits)
2. `\\d` also matches digits
3. The `*` quantifier combined with the alternation `|` causes the regex engine to try exponentially many combinations when the input doesn't match

**Fix:** Simplified the regex from:
```java
"(-?(?:\\d{1,19}|(?:.|\\d)*))(?:\\.\\d{1,19})?"
```
to:
```java
"(-?\\d{1,19})(?:\\.\\d{1,19})?"
```

The new pattern correctly matches:
- An optional negative sign `-?`
- 1-19 digits `\\d{1,19}` (representing seconds)
- Optionally followed by a decimal point and 1-19 more digits `(?:\\.\\d{1,19})?` (representing sub-second precision)

This pattern properly validates PAX extended header time values according to the POSIX specification while avoiding catastrophic backtracking. The `(?:.|\\d)*` alternative was unnecessary and dangerous - if the value doesn't match the proper numeric format, it should be rejected rather than allowing arbitrary characters.
