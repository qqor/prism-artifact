Now I understand the vulnerability. The `processURL` method (lines 268-285) is making outbound HTTP connections based on URLs extracted from CSV cell content. This is an SSRF vulnerability because untrusted user input (URLs in CSV hyperlinks) is used to make server-side requests.

The fix should disable or remove the functionality that fetches external URLs from CSV content. The safest approach is to remove the code that makes HTTP connections in `processURL`.

Now let me also remove the unused imports that are no longer needed since we removed the URL fetching code:

The patch has been applied successfully. Here's a summary of the fix:

## SSRF Vulnerability Fix Applied

**File Modified:** `tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-text-module/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/parser/csv/TextAndCSVParser.java`

**Vulnerability:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - The `processURL` method was making outbound HTTP connections to URLs extracted from CSV cell content (hyperlinks). An attacker could craft a malicious CSV file with `=HYPERLINK()` formulas containing URLs to internal services, leading to potential data exfiltration or exposure of internal network resources.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Removed the HTTP connection logic from the `processURL` method. The method now does nothing (the hyperlink is still rendered in the output but no outbound connection is made).

2. Removed the following unused imports that were only needed for the URL fetching code:
   - `java.net.URL`
   - `java.net.URLConnection`
   - `org.apache.tika.extractor.EmbeddedDocumentExtractor`
   - `org.apache.tika.extractor.EmbeddedDocumentUtil`
   - `org.apache.tika.io.TikaInputStream`
   - `org.apache.tika.utils.ExceptionUtils`

The hyperlink content (URL and display name) is still extracted and written to the output as an `<a href>` element, but the parser no longer fetches content from external URLs, eliminating the SSRF vulnerability.
