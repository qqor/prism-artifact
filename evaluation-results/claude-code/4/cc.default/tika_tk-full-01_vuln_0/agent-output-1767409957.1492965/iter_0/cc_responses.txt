Let me read the vulnerable XLIFF12Parser.java file:

I can see the issue. The `XLIFF12Parser` is using a `SAXParserFactory` without disabling external entity processing, which allows XML External Entity (XXE) attacks that can lead to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The crash log shows the XML parser is trying to connect to `jazze.com:80`, which is caused by an external entity reference in the malicious XML input.

The fix is to configure the SAXParserFactory to disable external entities and DTDs. Let me create the patch:

The patch has been applied successfully. Here's a summary of the fix:

## Summary

**Vulnerability**: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via XML External Entity (XXE) attack in `XLIFF12Parser.java`

**Root Cause**: The `SAXParserFactory` was created without disabling external entity processing. This allowed malicious XML input with external entity declarations to trigger network requests to arbitrary URLs (in this case, `jazze.com:80`).

**Fix Applied**: Added security features to the `SAXParserFactory` configuration to disable:
1. `disallow-doctype-decl` - Completely disallows DOCTYPE declarations
2. `external-general-entities` - Disables external general entity references
3. `external-parameter-entities` - Disables external parameter entity references  
4. `load-external-dtd` - Prevents loading external DTDs

These settings prevent the XML parser from resolving external entities, which eliminates the SSRF vulnerability while still allowing the parser to process legitimate XLIFF 1.2 documents.
