Looking at the crash log and the failed patches, I can see the issue:

The crash occurs at `Type1Lexer.java:247` in the `readToken` method. The problem is that the code is stuck in an **infinite loop** in the outer `do-while` loop, not the inner `while` loop.

## Why the patches failed:

1. **First patch**: Added a check `if (!buffer.hasRemaining()) break;` at the end of the do-while loop. This doesn't work because the `skip` variable can be set to `true` even when the buffer is exhausted, causing the loop to continue forever.

2. **Second patch**: Added iteration counting in the inner `while` loop. This doesn't work because the infinite loop is in the **outer do-while loop**, not the inner while loop. The `skip` variable keeps getting set to `true`, causing the outer loop to repeat indefinitely even when no progress is being made.

## Root cause:

The outer `do-while(skip)` loop can run indefinitely if `skip` keeps getting set to `true` without consuming any characters from the buffer. This can happen when the buffer gets repositioned or in certain edge cases.

## Solution:

We need to track whether the outer loop is making progress. If we go through an iteration without consuming any characters from the buffer, we should break out of the loop.

Let me first examine the code to understand the structure better:

Now I can see the issue clearly. The problem is in the `readToken` method at lines 119-248. The outer `do-while(skip)` loop continues as long as `skip` is true. The issue is:

1. When `skip = true` is set (lines 199, 204), the loop continues
2. If the buffer reaches the end (`!buffer.hasRemaining()`), the inner while loop exits
3. But `skip` is still `true`, so the outer do-while loop continues
4. The inner while loop condition `buffer.hasRemaining()` is false, so it immediately exits
5. The do-while checks `skip` again - still true - infinite loop!

The key insight is that **when we exit the inner while loop because the buffer is exhausted (`!buffer.hasRemaining()`), we should break out of the outer loop regardless of the `skip` flag**.

Here's the correct fix:

         return null;
```

Wait, let me reconsider this. The logic is getting complex. Let me think of a simpler approach.

The real issue is: **when `skip=true` is set and we reach the end of the buffer, we should stop looping**. The simplest fix is to check if the buffer is empty right after the inner while loop exits:

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the patch in diff format:

## Summary

### Why the previous patches failed:

1. **First patch**: Added a check at the end of the do-while loop to break if `buffer.hasRemaining()` is false. However, this doesn't solve the problem because the infinite loop occurs when `skip=true` but the buffer is already exhausted. The condition is checked AFTER the do-while condition evaluates, so the loop continues before hitting the break.

2. **Second patch**: Added iteration counting in the **inner while loop**. The problem is that the infinite loop happens in the **outer do-while loop**, not the inner one. When `skip=true` and the buffer is exhausted, the inner loop immediately exits (because `!buffer.hasRemaining()`), but the outer do-while loop continues forever because `skip` remains true.

### The root cause:

The infinite loop occurs when:
- `skip` is set to `true` (e.g., when encountering whitespace or NULL bytes at lines 204, 209)
- The buffer gets exhausted (`!buffer.hasRemaining()`)
- The outer `do-while(skip)` loop continues because `skip=true`
- The inner `while(buffer.hasRemaining())` immediately exits because the buffer is empty
- This repeats infinitely

### The new approach:

The fix uses a **completely different approach** with multiple safety mechanisms:

1. **Position tracking**: Tracks the buffer position at the start of each outer loop iteration
2. **Break on no progress**: If `skip=true` but the buffer position hasn't changed, we break (line 254)
3. **Break on buffer exhaustion**: If the buffer is exhausted, we break immediately (line 254)
4. **Loop counter safety**: Added a maximum loop count (1,000,000 iterations) as a final safety net (lines 260-264)

         }
         while (skip);
         return null;
```

This fix prevents the infinite loop by ensuring the outer do-while loop terminates when either:
1. The buffer is completely exhausted
2. No progress is being made (position unchanged and skip=true)
3. The loop has iterated too many times (safety net)
