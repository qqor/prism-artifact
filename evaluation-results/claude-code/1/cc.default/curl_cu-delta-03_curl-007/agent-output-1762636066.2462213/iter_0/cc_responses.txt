I'll analyze the crash log and create a patch to fix the AddressSanitizer SEGV bug.

The crash occurs at `/src/curl/lib/alliswellprotocoll.c:253:33` with a null pointer dereference during a WRITE operation. Let me first examine the source code to understand the issue.

Good! The file exists in the current directory. Let me read it to understand the issue:

Now I can see the issue! At line 253, there's a clear bug:

```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```

This line is attempting to write to memory by casting the `result` variable (which is a `CURLcode` enum value, not a pointer) as if it were a pointer to an unsigned int. This is causing the null pointer dereference crash.

The fix is simple - this line should just be:
```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

Let me also check if there are any other issues in the code and then create and apply the patch:

Excellent! The fix has been successfully applied. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary

I've successfully identified and fixed the **AddressSanitizer SEGV bug** in `./lib/alliswellprotocoll.c`.

### Root Cause
The crash occurred at line 253 in the `alliswellprotocoll_sm` function. The problematic code was:
```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```

This line attempted to cast the `result` variable (a `CURLcode` enum value) as if it were a pointer to an unsigned int and then dereference it for a write operation. Since `result` is not a pointer but a local variable on the stack, this resulted in writing to an invalid memory address (likely 0x0, the null page), causing the segmentation fault.

### The Fix
Changed line 253 from:
```c
*(unsigned int *)result = CURLE_OK;
```
to:
```c
result = CURLE_OK;
```

This is the correct way to assign a value to the `result` variable - a simple assignment without any pointer dereferencing.

### Files Modified
- `./lib/alliswellprotocoll.c` - Line 253

### Patch File
The patch has been created and saved to `/tmp/fix_segv.patch` for reference.

The fix has been applied to the source code, and the bug should now be resolved. The crash was caused by an obvious programming error (treating a value as a pointer), and the fix ensures proper assignment semantics.
