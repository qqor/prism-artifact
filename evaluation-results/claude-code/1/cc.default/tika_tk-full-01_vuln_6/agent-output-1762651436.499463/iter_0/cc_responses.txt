I'll analyze the crash log and create a patch to fix the file path traversal vulnerability in the TikaUntar code.

Let me first explore the codebase to understand the structure and locate the vulnerable file.

Now I can see the vulnerability. The issue is on line 43 where the code resolves the tar entry name with the extract directory, but doesn't validate that the resulting path is actually within the intended extraction directory. This allows path traversal attacks using entries like `../../etc/passwd` or similar.

The crash log shows the traversal path: `/tmp/expander-tmp17290040960515240899/output/q/r/jazzer-traversal`

Let me create a patch to fix this vulnerability:

Excellent! The patch has been successfully applied to the code. Let me create a summary of the fix:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the **file path traversal vulnerability** in `TikaUntar.java`. 

### The Vulnerability
The original code (line 43) was resolving tar entry names with the extraction directory without validating that the resulting path stayed within the intended extraction directory. This allowed malicious tar archives to use path traversal sequences like `../../` to write files outside the extraction directory.

### The Fix
I added a security check (lines 44-47) that:
1. Normalizes both the target path and the extraction directory path
2. Verifies that the target path starts with the extraction directory path
3. Throws an `IOException` if a path traversal attempt is detected

This ensures that all extracted files remain within the intended extraction directory, preventing the `FuzzerSecurityIssueCritical: File path traversal` error.

### Changed File
- **File**: `./tika-app/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/cli/TikaUntar.java`
- **Lines modified**: Added validation check at lines 44-47

The fix follows security best practices for preventing directory traversal attacks in archive extraction utilities.
