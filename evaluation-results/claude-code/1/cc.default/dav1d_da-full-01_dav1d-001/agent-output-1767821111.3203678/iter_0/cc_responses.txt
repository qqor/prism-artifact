Let me look for OSS-Fuzz integration and the build process:

Now I can see the issue. The crash log shows "Permission denied" when trying to execute `/out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt`. Looking at the build output directory:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 qqor qqor 11398664 Jan  8 06:25 dav1d_fuzzer_mt
```

The fuzzer binary is missing the executable permission! Let me check the build scripts in the source directory:

Now I understand the bug! The issue is in `tests/libfuzzer/dav1d_fuzzer_mt@NO_OOM`. This is a wrapper script that:

1. `chmod +x` the fuzzer before running it (line 17)
2. Runs the fuzzer
3. `chmod -x` the fuzzer after running (line 24)

However, when the fuzzer runs directly (not through this wrapper), it has no executable permission because the build process or some other mechanism is removing the execute bit.

Looking at the crash log more closely:
- The fuzzer `dav1d_fuzzer_mt` is being called directly (not through the `@NO_OOM` wrapper)
- The binary doesn't have execute permissions: `-rw-r--r--` instead of `-rwxr-xr-x`

The bug is in the `dav1d_fuzzer_mt@NO_OOM` script which removes executable permissions from `dav1d_fuzzer_mt` after running (line 24). This means if the wrapper runs and then the direct binary is called, it fails.

The fix should be to **not** remove the executable permission after running. Let me create a patch:

The patch has been successfully applied to fix the bug. Here's a summary of what was fixed:

## Bug Fix Summary

**File Modified:** `tests/libfuzzer/dav1d_fuzzer_mt@NO_OOM`

**Problem:** The crash log showed `bash: /out/dav1d_fuzzer_mt: Permission denied` (exit status 126). This was caused by the `dav1d_fuzzer_mt` binary not having executable permissions (`-rw-r--r--` instead of `-rwxr-xr-x`).

**Root Cause:** The original wrapper script was intentionally removing the executable permission (`chmod -x`) from `dav1d_fuzzer_mt` after each run (line 24 of the original file). This was done as a workaround to prevent the infrastructure from "picking up" the binary, but it caused the direct fuzzer to fail when called outside of the wrapper.

**Fix Applied:** Removed the `chmod -x $this_dir/dav1d_fuzzer_mt` line and its associated comment. Now the script:
1. Sets the binary as executable (`chmod +x`)
2. Runs the fuzzer
3. **No longer removes** the executable permission afterward

This ensures that:
- The wrapper script (`dav1d_fuzzer_mt@NO_OOM`) continues to work
- The direct fuzzer binary (`dav1d_fuzzer_mt`) remains executable and can be called directly without permission errors
