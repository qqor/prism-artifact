I tried to fix a  vulnerability causing the crash log in the <crash_log> below.
I failed to fix the vulnerability with the following patches:

Explain why the patches failed and provide a new patch to fix the vulnerability.
Do not repeat the same mistakes in the new patch.
Try a completely different approach to fix the vulnerability.
NEVER fix files outside the source directory.
NEVER do any git operations in or outside the source directory.

Below is the crash log:
